# Robotics Python Nodes

Welcome to **Robotics Python Nodes**, a collection of Python scripts for solving various robotics-related tasks. This repository is meant for developers, students, hobbyists, and researchers who want to explore or build different robotic functionalities using Python.

Each Python script in this repository is a self-contained **node** (or module) that solves a specific robotics task — from basic maze solving to people detection and sensor processing.

---

## Repository Structure

- `maze_solver.py` – Solves a 2D maze using depth-first search (DFS).
- `obstacle_avoidance.py` – Basic obstacle avoidance logic for mobile robots.
- `people_detection.py` – Detects humans using image processing (OpenCV or TensorFlow).
- `line_follower.py` – Logic for line-following robots.
- `sensor_reader.py` – Reads and processes input from different sensors (IR, ultrasonic).
- `motor_control.py` – Controls DC or servo motors via GPIO or serial commands.
- `object_tracking.py` – Tracks moving objects using camera input.
- `face_recognition.py` – Detects and recognizes faces in real-time.
- `speech_control.py` – Voice command control for simple robot actions.

> More scripts will be added regularly! You can also contribute by submitting your own nodes.
